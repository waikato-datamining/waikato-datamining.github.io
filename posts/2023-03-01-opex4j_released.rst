`Recently <2023-01-25-opex-support-expanded>`__, we extended the support
for the `OPEX format <https://github.com/WaikatoLink2020/objdet-predictions-exchange-format>`__
in some of our Docker images. So far, there was only language support available for Python.
With today's release of `opex4j <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/opex4j>`__, there is
now a Java library for this exchange format available as well.
