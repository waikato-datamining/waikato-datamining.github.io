Our commercial offering for environmental laboratories, `S3000 <link://slug/s3000>`__, now has official data
fusion support. With this in place, labs can now take advantage of combining data generated from the
same sample using multiple instruments (e.g., `NIR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy>`__
and `XRF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence>`__) to improve accuracy of their models.
