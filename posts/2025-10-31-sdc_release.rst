A new release of our `spectral-data-converter-all <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/spectral-data-converter-all>`__ library
is now available: **0.1.0**. Docker images have been deployed as well.

Just like with the `image-dataset-converter-all <link://slug/2025-10-31-idc-release>`__, this release benefits from
the major overhaul under the hood and the integration of the `kasperl` libraries.

Check out the `examples <https://www.data-mining.co.nz/spectral-data-converter-examples/>`__ as well.
