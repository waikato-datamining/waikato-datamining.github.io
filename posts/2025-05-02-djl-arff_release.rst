`Deep Java Library (DJL) <https://djl.ai/>`__ is an open source library to build and deploy deep learning in Java,
developed by Amazon.com. Besides the usual image models, it also offers some basic support for tabular data.
Since its input is limited to CSV files, I decided to add support for `Weka ARFF files <https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/formats_and_processing/arff/>`__.

The result of this effort is the `djl-arff` library:
