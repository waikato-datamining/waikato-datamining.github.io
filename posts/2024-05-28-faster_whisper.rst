New Docker images are now available for speech-to-text using `Faster Whisper <https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper>`__ 1.0.2:

`https://github.com/waikato-llm/whisper/tree/main/faster-whisper-1.0.2_cuda12.1 <https://github.com/waikato-llm/whisper/tree/main/faster-whisper-1.0.2_cuda12.1>`__

`https://github.com/waikato-llm/whisper/tree/main/faster-whisper-1.0.2_cpu <https://github.com/waikato-llm/whisper/tree/main/faster-whisper-1.0.2_cpu>`__

Faster Whisper is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper library with some `dramatic speed ups <https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper#benchmark>`__.

With the release of these images, the Coqui STT images have been retired (just like the `Coqui STT project itself <https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/blob/main/README.rst>`__).
