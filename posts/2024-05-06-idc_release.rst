Based on lessons learned from our `wai-annotations <https://github.com/waikato-ufdl/wai-annotations>`__ library,
we simplified and streamlined the design of a data processing library (though limited to just image datasets).
Of course, it makes use of the latest `seppl <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/seppl>`__ version, which also
simplified how plugins are being located at runtime and development time.

The new kid on the block is called **image-dataset-converter** and its code is located here:

`https://github.com/waikato-datamining/image-dataset-converter <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/image-dataset-converter>`__

Whilst it is based on wai-annotations, it already contains additional functionality.

And, of course, we also have resources demonstrating how to use the new library:
