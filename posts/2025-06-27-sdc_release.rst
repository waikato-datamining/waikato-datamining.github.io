The first release of our `spectral-data-converter-all <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/spectral-data-converter-all>`__ library
is now available: **0.0.1**. Docker images have been deployed as well.

This library allows you to define and run processing pipelines on the command-line, e.g., for:

* converting data from one format into another (e.g., OPUS to NIR)
* clean the data (e.g., IQR)
* transform the data (e.g., SIMPLS, PLS1, standardize)
* build and apply scikit-learn models

You can find examples for various scenarios here:
