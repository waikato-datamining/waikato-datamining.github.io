For our own projects, we make a lot of use of `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__, to better manage
the varying (and often clashing) requirements for CUDA and Python libraries. We not only offer a quick
introduction to `docker for data scientists <https://www.data-mining.co.nz/docker-for-data-scientists/>`__,
but we also make (most of) our Docker images freely available. You can obtain the images from two sources:

* `In-house Registry <link://slug/docker-images-inhouse>`__
* `Docker Hub <link://slug/docker-images-dockerhub>`__
