A new Docker image for building models with version 0.5 of `Detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2>`__ is available:

More information on the Docker image is available from Github:

`github.com/waikato-datamining/pytorch/tree/master/detectron2/0.5 <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/pytorch/tree/master/detectron2/0.5>`__

This image supersedes the 0.4 version, as that image was never used in production.

**Update**

The image now uses CUDA 11.1, which allows the image to be run on the 3xxx series of Nvidia graphics cards.
