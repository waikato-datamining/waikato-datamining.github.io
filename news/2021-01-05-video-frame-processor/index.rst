The **video-frame-processor** Python 3 library has been released today:

`github.com/waikato-datamining/video-frame-processor <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/video-frame-processor>`__

While it is easy with opencv to open files and webcams, there is no
point in writing the same code over and over again. This is where
the *video-frame-processor* library comes in, allowing you to
concentrate on the *processing* of the frames from the video source.
